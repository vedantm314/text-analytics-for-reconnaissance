On September 7, 2021, at approximately 13:47 local time, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake, with a depth of 20 km, struck 1 km West-Southwest of of Acapulco, Mexico. The coordinate of epicenter of the earthquake was 16.9816°N, 99.7726°W.

Located atop three of the large tectonic plates, Mexico 
is one of the world's most seismically active regions. 
The relative motion of these crustal plates causes frequent 
earthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. 
Most of the 
Mexican landmass is on the westward moving North American 
plate. The Pacific Ocean floor south of Mexico is being 
carried northeastward by the underlying Cocos plate. Because 
oceanic crust is relatively dense, when the Pacific Ocean 
floor encounters the lighter continental crust of the Mexican 
landmass, the ocean floor is subducted beneath the North 
American plate creating the deep Middle American trench 
along Mexico's southern coast. Also as a result of this 
convergence, the westward moving Mexico landmass is slowed 
and crumpled creating the mountain ranges of southern Mexico 
and earthquakes near Mexico's southern coast. As the oceanic 
crust is pulled downward, it melts; the molten material is then 
forced upward through weaknesses in the overlying continental 
crust. This process has created a region of volcanoes across 
south-central Mexico known as the Cordillera Neovolcánica.

The area west of the Gulf of California, including Mexico's Baja 
California Peninsula, is moving northwestward with the Pacific 
plate at about 50 mm per year. Here, the Pacific and North American 
plates grind past each other creating strike-slip faulting, the 
southern extension of California's San Andreas fault. In the past, 
this relative plate motion pulled Baja California away from the coast 
forming the Gulf of California and is the cause of earthquakes in the 
Gulf of California region today.

Mexico has a long history of destructive earthquakes and volcanic 
eruptions. In September 1985, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake killed 
more than 9,500 people in Mexico City. In southern Mexico, Volcán 
de Colima and El Chichón erupted in 2005 and 1982, respectively. 
Paricutín volcano, west of Mexico City, began venting smoke in a 
cornfield in 1943; a decade later this new volcano had grown to a 
height of 424 meters. Popocatépetl and Ixtaccíhuatl volcanos 
("smoking mountain" and "white lady", respectively), southeast 
of Mexico City, occasionally vent gas that can be clearly seen from the City, 
a reminder that volcanic activity is ongoing. In 1994 and 2000 Popocatépetl 
renewed its activity forcing the evacuation of nearby towns, causing 
seismologists and government officials to be concerned about the effect a 
large-scale eruption might have on the heavily populated region. 
Popocatépetl volcano last erupted in 2010.
