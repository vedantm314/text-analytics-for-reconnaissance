Extensive diversity and complexity of tectonic regimes characterizes the perimeter 
of the Caribbean plate, involving no fewer than four major plates (North America, 
South America, Nazca, and Cocos). Inclined zones of deep earthquakes 
(Wadati-Benioff zones), ocean trenches, and arcs of volcanoes clearly indicate 
subduction of oceanic lithosphere along the Central American and Atlantic Ocean 
margins of the Caribbean plate, while crustal seismicity in Guatemala, northern 
Venezuela, and the Cayman Ridge and Cayman Trench indicate transform fault 
and pull-apart basin tectonics.

Along the northern margin of the Caribbean plate, the North America plate moves 
westwards with respect to the Caribbean plate at a velocity of approximately 20 
mm/yr. Motion is accommodated along several major transform faults that extend 
eastward from Isla de Roatan to Haiti, including the Swan Island Fault and the 
Oriente Fault. These faults represent the southern and northern boundaries of the 
Cayman Trench. Further east, from the Dominican Republic to the Island of Barbuda, 
relative motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean plate becomes 
increasingly complex and is partially accommodated by nearly arc-parallel subduction 
of the North America plate beneath the Caribbean plate. This results in the formation 
of the deep Puerto Rico Trench and a zone of intermediate focus earthquakes 
(70-300 km depth) within the subducted slab. Although the Puerto Rico subduction 
zone is thought to be capable of generating a megathrust earthquake, there have 
been no such events in the past century. The last probable interplate (thrust fault) 
event here occurred on May 2, 1787 and was widely felt throughout the island with 
documented destruction across the entire northern coast, including Arecibo and San 
Juan. Since 1900, the two largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the 
August 4, 1946 M8.0 Samana earthquake in northeastern Hispaniola and the July 29, 
1943 M7.6 Mona Passage earthquake, both of which were shallow thrust fault earthquakes. 
A significant portion of the motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean 
plate in this region is accommodated by a series of left-lateral strike-slip faults that bisect 
the island of Hispaniola, notably the Septentrional Fault in the north and the 
Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault in the south. Activity adjacent to the Enriquillo-Plantain 
Garden Fault system is best documented by the devastating January 12, 2010 M7.0 Haiti 
strike-slip earthquake, its associated aftershocks and a comparable earthquake in 1770.

Moving east and south, the plate boundary curves around Puerto Rico and the northern 
Lesser Antilles where the plate motion vector of the Caribbean plate relative to the North 
and South America plates is less oblique, resulting in active island-arc tectonics.  Here, the 
North and South America plates subduct towards the west beneath the Caribbean plate 
along the Lesser Antilles Trench at rates of approximately 20 mm/yr. As a result of this 
subduction, there exists both intermediate focus earthquakes within the subducted plates 
and a chain of active volcanoes along the island arc. Although the Lesser Antilles is 
considered one of the most seismically active regions in the Caribbean, few of these events 
have been greater than M7.0 over the past century. The island of Guadeloupe was the site 
of one of the largest megathrust earthquakes to occur in this region on February 8, 1843, 
with a suggested magnitude greater than 8.0. The largest recent intermediate-depth 
earthquake to occur along the Lesser Antilles arc was the November 29, 2007 M7.4 
Martinique earthquake northwest of Fort-De-France.

The southern Caribbean plate boundary with the South America plate strikes east-west 
across Trinidad and western Venezuela at a relative rate of approximately 20 mm/yr. 
This boundary is characterized by major transform faults, including the Central Range 
Fault and the Boconó-San Sebastian-El Pilar Faults, and shallow seismicity. Since 1900, 
the largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the October 29, 1900 M7.7 Caracas 
earthquake, and the July 29, 1967 M6.5 earthquake near this same region. Further to 
the west, a broad zone of compressive deformation trends southwestward across western 
Venezuela and central Colombia. The plate boundary is not well defined across northwestern 
South America, but deformation transitions from being dominated by Caribbean/South America 
convergence in the east to Nazca/South America convergence in the west. The transition zone 
between subduction on the eastern and western margins of the Caribbean plate is 
characterized by diffuse seismicity involving low- to intermediate-magnitude (M<6.0) 
earthquakes of shallow to intermediate depth.

The plate boundary offshore of Colombia is also characterized by convergence, where the Nazca 
plate subducts beneath South America towards the east at a rate of approximately 65 mm/yr.  
The January 31, 1906 M8.5 earthquake occurred on the shallowly dipping megathrust interface 
of this plate boundary segment.  Along the western coast of Central America, the Cocos plate 
subducts towards the east beneath the Caribbean plate at the Middle America Trench. 
Convergence rates vary between 72-81 mm/yr, decreasing towards the north. This subduction 
results in relatively high rates of seismicity and a chain of numerous active volcanoes; 
intermediate-focus earthquakes occur within the subducted Cocos plate to depths of nearly 300 km. 
Since 1900, there have been many moderately sized intermediate-depth earthquakes in this region, 
including the September 7, 1915 M7.4 El Salvador and the October 5, 1950 M7.8 Costa Rica events.

The boundary between the Cocos and Nazca plates is characterized by a series of north-south trending 
transform faults and east-west trending spreading centers. The largest and most seismically active of 
these transform boundaries is the Panama Fracture Zone. The Panama Fracture Zone terminates in the 
south at the Galapagos rift zone and in the north at the Middle America trench, where it forms part of 
the Cocos-Nazca-Caribbean triple junction. Earthquakes along the Panama Fracture Zone are generally 
shallow, low- to intermediate in magnitude (M<7.2) and are characteristically right-lateral strike-slip 
faulting earthquakes.  Since 1900, the largest earthquake to occur along the Panama Fracture Zone was 
the July 26, 1962 M7.2 earthquake.

characterized by diffuse seismicity involving low- to intermediate-magnitude (M<6.0) 
earthquakes of shallow to intermediate depth.

The plate boundary offshore of Colombia is also characterized by convergence, where the Nazca 
plate subducts beneath South America towards the east at a rate of approximately 65 mm/yr.  
The January 31, 1906 M8.5 earthquake occurred on the shallowly dipping megathrust interface 
of this plate boundary segment.  Along the western coast of Central America, the Cocos plate 
subducts towards the east beneath the Caribbean plate at the Middle America Trench. 
Convergence rates vary between 72-81 mm/yr, decreasing towards the north. This subduction 
results in relatively high rates of seismicity and a chain of numerous active volcanoes; 
intermediate-focus earthquakes occur within the subducted Cocos plate to depths of nearly 300 km. 
Since 1900, there have been many moderately sized intermediate-depth earthquakes in this region, 
including the September 7, 1915 M7.4 El Salvador and the October 5, 1950 M7.8 Costa Rica events.

The boundary between the Cocos and Nazca plates is characterized by a series of north-south trending 
transform faults and east-west trending spreading centers. The largest and most seismically active of 
these transform boundaries is the Panama Fracture Zone. The Panama Fracture Zone terminates in the 
south at the Galapagos rift zone and in the north at the Middle America trench, where it forms part of 
the Cocos-Nazca-Caribbean triple junction. Earthquakes along the Panama Fracture Zone are generally 
shallow, low- to intermediate in magnitude (M<7.2) and are characteristically right-lateral strike-slip 
faulting earthquakes.  Since 1900, the largest earthquake to occur along the Panama Fracture Zone was 
the July 26, 1962 M7.2 earthquake.

On August 14, 2021, at approximately 16:20 local time, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake, with a depth of 12.04 km, struck 12 km North-Northeast of of Chardonnière, Haiti. The coordinate of epicenter of the earthquake was 18.3711°N, 74.0992°W.

Extensive diversity and complexity of tectonic regimes characterizes the perimeter 
of the Caribbean plate, involving no fewer than four major plates (North America, 
South America, Nazca, and Cocos). Inclined zones of deep earthquakes 
(Wadati-Benioff zones), ocean trenches, and arcs of volcanoes clearly indicate 
subduction of oceanic lithosphere along the Central American and Atlantic Ocean 
margins of the Caribbean plate, while crustal seismicity in Guatemala, northern 
Venezuela, and the Cayman Ridge and Cayman Trench indicate transform fault 
and pull-apart basin tectonics.

Along the northern margin of the Caribbean plate, the North America plate moves 
westwards with respect to the Caribbean plate at a velocity of approximately 20 
mm/yr. Motion is accommodated along several major transform faults that extend 
eastward from Isla de Roatan to Haiti, including the Swan Island Fault and the 
Oriente Fault. These faults represent the southern and northern boundaries of the 
Cayman Trench. Further east, from the Dominican Republic to the Island of Barbuda, 
relative motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean plate becomes 
increasingly complex and is partially accommodated by nearly arc-parallel subduction 
of the North America plate beneath the Caribbean plate. This results in the formation 
of the deep Puerto Rico Trench and a zone of intermediate focus earthquakes 
(70-300 km depth) within the subducted slab. Although the Puerto Rico subduction 
zone is thought to be capable of generating a megathrust earthquake, there have 
been no such events in the past century. The last probable interplate (thrust fault) 
event here occurred on May 2, 1787 and was widely felt throughout the island with 
documented destruction across the entire northern coast, including Arecibo and San 
Juan. Since 1900, the two largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the 
August 4, 1946 M8.0 Samana earthquake in northeastern Hispaniola and the July 29, 
1943 M7.6 Mona Passage earthquake, both of which were shallow thrust fault earthquakes. 
A significant portion of the motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean 
plate in this region is accommodated by a series of left-lateral strike-slip faults that bisect 
the island of Hispaniola, notably the Septentrional Fault in the north and the 
Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault in the south. Activity adjacent to the Enriquillo-Plantain 
Garden Fault system is best documented by the devastating January 12, 2010 M7.0 Haiti 
strike-slip earthquake, its associated aftershocks and a comparable earthquake in 1770.

Moving east and south, the plate boundary curves around Puerto Rico and the northern 
Lesser Antilles where the plate motion vector of the Caribbean plate relative to the North 
and South America plates is less oblique, resulting in active island-arc tectonics.  Here, the 
North and South America plates subduct towards the west beneath the Caribbean plate 
along the Lesser Antilles Trench at rates of approximately 20 mm/yr. As a result of this 
subduction, there exists both intermediate focus earthquakes within the subducted plates 
and a chain of active volcanoes along the island arc. Although the Lesser Antilles is 
considered one of the most seismically active regions in the Caribbean, few of these events 
have been greater than M7.0 over the past century. The island of Guadeloupe was the site 
of one of the largest megathrust earthquakes to occur in this region on February 8, 1843, 
with a suggested magnitude greater than 8.0. The largest recent intermediate-depth 
earthquake to occur along the Lesser Antilles arc was the November 29, 2007 M7.4 
Martinique earthquake northwest of Fort-De-France.

The southern Caribbean plate boundary with the South America plate strikes east-west 
across Trinidad and western Venezuela at a relative rate of approximately 20 mm/yr. 
This boundary is characterized by major transform faults, including the Central Range 
Fault and the Boconó-San Sebastian-El Pilar Faults, and shallow seismicity. Since 1900, 
the largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the October 29, 1900 M7.7 Caracas 
earthquake, and the July 29, 1967 M6.5 earthquake near this same region. Further to 
the west, a broad zone of compressive deformation trends southwestward across western 
Venezuela and central Colombia. The plate boundary is not well defined across northwestern 
South America, but deformation transitions from being dominated by Caribbean/South America 
convergence in the east to Nazca/South America convergence in the west. The transition zone 
between subduction on the eastern and western margins of the Caribbean plate is 
characterized by diffuse seismicity involving low- to intermediate-magnitude (M<6.0) 
earthquakes of shallow to intermediate depth.

event here occurred on May 2, 1787 and was widely felt throughout the island with 
documented destruction across the entire northern coast, including Arecibo and San 
Juan. Since 1900, the two largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the 
August 4, 1946 M8.0 Samana earthquake in northeastern Hispaniola and the July 29, 
1943 M7.6 Mona Passage earthquake, both of which were shallow thrust fault earthquakes. 
A significant portion of the motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean 
plate in this region is accommodated by a series of left-lateral strike-slip faults that bisect 
the island of Hispaniola, notably the Septentrional Fault in the north and the 
Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault in the south. Activity adjacent to the Enriquillo-Plantain 
Garden Fault system is best documented by the devastating January 12, 2010 M7.0 Haiti 
strike-slip earthquake, its associated aftershocks and a comparable earthquake in 1770.

Moving east and south, the plate boundary curves around Puerto Rico and the northern 
Lesser Antilles where the plate motion vector of the Caribbean plate relative to the North 
and South America plates is less oblique, resulting in active island-arc tectonics.  Here, the 
North and South America plates subduct towards the west beneath the Caribbean plate 
along the Lesser Antilles Trench at rates of approximately 20 mm/yr. As a result of this 
subduction, there exists both intermediate focus earthquakes within the subducted plates 
and a chain of active volcanoes along the island arc. Although the Lesser Antilles is 
considered one of the most seismically active regions in the Caribbean, few of these events 
have been greater than M7.0 over the past century. The island of Guadeloupe was the site 
of one of the largest megathrust earthquakes to occur in this region on February 8, 1843, 
with a suggested magnitude greater than 8.0. The largest recent intermediate-depth 
earthquake to occur along the Lesser Antilles arc was the November 29, 2007 M7.4 
Martinique earthquake northwest of Fort-De-France.

The southern Caribbean plate boundary with the South America plate strikes east-west 
across Trinidad and western Venezuela at a relative rate of approximately 20 mm/yr. 
This boundary is characterized by major transform faults, including the Central Range 
Fault and the Boconó-San Sebastian-El Pilar Faults, and shallow seismicity. Since 1900, 
the largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the October 29, 1900 M7.7 Caracas 
earthquake, and the July 29, 1967 M6.5 earthquake near this same region. Further to 
the west, a broad zone of compressive deformation trends southwestward across western 
Venezuela and central Colombia. The plate boundary is not well defined across northwestern 
South America, but deformation transitions from being dominated by Caribbean/South America 
convergence in the east to Nazca/South America convergence in the west. The transition zone 
between subduction on the eastern and western margins of the Caribbean plate is 
characterized by diffuse seismicity involving low- to intermediate-magnitude (M<6.0) 
earthquakes of shallow to intermediate depth.

The plate boundary offshore of Colombia is also characterized by convergence, where the Nazca 
plate subducts beneath South America towards the east at a rate of approximately 65 mm/yr.  
The January 31, 1906 M8.5 earthquake occurred on the shallowly dipping megathrust interface 
of this plate boundary segment.  Along the western coast of Central America, the Cocos plate 
subducts towards the east beneath the Caribbean plate at the Middle America Trench. 
Convergence rates vary between 72-81 mm/yr, decreasing towards the north. This subduction 
results in relatively high rates of seismicity and a chain of numerous active volcanoes; 
intermediate-focus earthquakes occur within the subducted Cocos plate to depths of nearly 300 km. 
Since 1900, there have been many moderately sized intermediate-depth earthquakes in this region, 
including the September 7, 1915 M7.4 El Salvador and the October 5, 1950 M7.8 Costa Rica events.

The boundary between the Cocos and Nazca plates is characterized by a series of north-south trending 
transform faults and east-west trending spreading centers. The largest and most seismically active of 
these transform boundaries is the Panama Fracture Zone. The Panama Fracture Zone terminates in the 
south at the Galapagos rift zone and in the north at the Middle America trench, where it forms part of 
the Cocos-Nazca-Caribbean triple junction. Earthquakes along the Panama Fracture Zone are generally 
shallow, low- to intermediate in magnitude (M<7.2) and are characteristically right-lateral strike-slip 
faulting earthquakes.  Since 1900, the largest earthquake to occur along the Panama Fracture Zone was 
the July 26, 1962 M7.2 earthquake.

On August 14, 2021, at approximately 1:29 local time, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake, with a depth of 10.0 km, struck 1 km Northwest of of Nippes, Haiti. The coordinate of epicenter of the earthquake was 18.4167°N, 73.4804°W.

Extensive diversity and complexity of tectonic regimes characterizes the perimeter 
of the Caribbean plate, involving no fewer than four major plates (North America, 
South America, Nazca, and Cocos). Inclined zones of deep earthquakes 
(Wadati-Benioff zones), ocean trenches, and arcs of volcanoes clearly indicate 
subduction of oceanic lithosphere along the Central American and Atlantic Ocean 
margins of the Caribbean plate, while crustal seismicity in Guatemala, northern 
Venezuela, and the Cayman Ridge and Cayman Trench indicate transform fault 
and pull-apart basin tectonics.

Along the northern margin of the Caribbean plate, the North America plate moves 
westwards with respect to the Caribbean plate at a velocity of approximately 20 
mm/yr. Motion is accommodated along several major transform faults that extend 
eastward from Isla de Roatan to Haiti, including the Swan Island Fault and the 
Oriente Fault. These faults represent the southern and northern boundaries of the 
Cayman Trench. Further east, from the Dominican Republic to the Island of Barbuda, 
relative motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean plate becomes 
increasingly complex and is partially accommodated by nearly arc-parallel subduction 
of the North America plate beneath the Caribbean plate. This results in the formation 
of the deep Puerto Rico Trench and a zone of intermediate focus earthquakes 
(70-300 km depth) within the subducted slab. Although the Puerto Rico subduction 
zone is thought to be capable of generating a megathrust earthquake, there have

the Cocos-Nazca-Caribbean triple junction. Earthquakes along the Panama Fracture Zone are generally 
shallow, low- to intermediate in magnitude (M<7.2) and are characteristically right-lateral strike-slip 
faulting earthquakes.  Since 1900, the largest earthquake to occur along the Panama Fracture Zone was 
the July 26, 1962 M7.2 earthquake.

On August 14, 2021, at approximately 1:29 local time, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake, with a depth of 10.0 km, struck 1 km Northwest of of Nippes, Haiti. The coordinate of epicenter of the earthquake was 18.4167°N, 73.4804°W.

Extensive diversity and complexity of tectonic regimes characterizes the perimeter 
of the Caribbean plate, involving no fewer than four major plates (North America, 
South America, Nazca, and Cocos). Inclined zones of deep earthquakes 
(Wadati-Benioff zones), ocean trenches, and arcs of volcanoes clearly indicate 
subduction of oceanic lithosphere along the Central American and Atlantic Ocean 
margins of the Caribbean plate, while crustal seismicity in Guatemala, northern 
Venezuela, and the Cayman Ridge and Cayman Trench indicate transform fault 
and pull-apart basin tectonics.

Along the northern margin of the Caribbean plate, the North America plate moves 
westwards with respect to the Caribbean plate at a velocity of approximately 20 
mm/yr. Motion is accommodated along several major transform faults that extend 
eastward from Isla de Roatan to Haiti, including the Swan Island Fault and the 
Oriente Fault. These faults represent the southern and northern boundaries of the 
Cayman Trench. Further east, from the Dominican Republic to the Island of Barbuda, 
relative motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean plate becomes 
increasingly complex and is partially accommodated by nearly arc-parallel subduction 
of the North America plate beneath the Caribbean plate. This results in the formation 
of the deep Puerto Rico Trench and a zone of intermediate focus earthquakes 
(70-300 km depth) within the subducted slab. Although the Puerto Rico subduction 
zone is thought to be capable of generating a megathrust earthquake, there have 
been no such events in the past century. The last probable interplate (thrust fault) 
event here occurred on May 2, 1787 and was widely felt throughout the island with 
documented destruction across the entire northern coast, including Arecibo and San 
Juan. Since 1900, the two largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the 
August 4, 1946 M8.0 Samana earthquake in northeastern Hispaniola and the July 29, 
1943 M7.6 Mona Passage earthquake, both of which were shallow thrust fault earthquakes. 
A significant portion of the motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean 
plate in this region is accommodated by a series of left-lateral strike-slip faults that bisect 
the island of Hispaniola, notably the Septentrional Fault in the north and the 
Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault in the south. Activity adjacent to the Enriquillo-Plantain 
Garden Fault system is best documented by the devastating January 12, 2010 M7.0 Haiti 
strike-slip earthquake, its associated aftershocks and a comparable earthquake in 1770.

Moving east and south, the plate boundary curves around Puerto Rico and the northern 
Lesser Antilles where the plate motion vector of the Caribbean plate relative to the North 
and South America plates is less oblique, resulting in active island-arc tectonics.  Here, the 
North and South America plates subduct towards the west beneath the Caribbean plate 
along the Lesser Antilles Trench at rates of approximately 20 mm/yr. As a result of this 
subduction, there exists both intermediate focus earthquakes within the subducted plates 
and a chain of active volcanoes along the island arc. Although the Lesser Antilles is 
considered one of the most seismically active regions in the Caribbean, few of these events 
have been greater than M7.0 over the past century. The island of Guadeloupe was the site 
of one of the largest megathrust earthquakes to occur in this region on February 8, 1843, 
with a suggested magnitude greater than 8.0. The largest recent intermediate-depth 
earthquake to occur along the Lesser Antilles arc was the November 29, 2007 M7.4 
Martinique earthquake northwest of Fort-De-France.

The southern Caribbean plate boundary with the South America plate strikes east-west 
across Trinidad and western Venezuela at a relative rate of approximately 20 mm/yr. 
This boundary is characterized by major transform faults, including the Central Range 
Fault and the Boconó-San Sebastian-El Pilar Faults, and shallow seismicity. Since 1900, 
the largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the October 29, 1900 M7.7 Caracas 
earthquake, and the July 29, 1967 M6.5 earthquake near this same region. Further to 
the west, a broad zone of compressive deformation trends southwestward across western 
Venezuela and central Colombia. The plate boundary is not well defined across northwestern 
South America, but deformation transitions from being dominated by Caribbean/South America 
convergence in the east to Nazca/South America convergence in the west. The transition zone 
between subduction on the eastern and western margins of the Caribbean plate is 
characterized by diffuse seismicity involving low- to intermediate-magnitude (M<6.0) 
earthquakes of shallow to intermediate depth.

The plate boundary offshore of Colombia is also characterized by convergence, where the Nazca 
plate subducts beneath South America towards the east at a rate of approximately 65 mm/yr.  
The January 31, 1906 M8.5 earthquake occurred on the shallowly dipping megathrust interface 
of this plate boundary segment.  Along the western coast of Central America, the Cocos plate 
subducts towards the east beneath the Caribbean plate at the Middle America Trench. 
Convergence rates vary between 72-81 mm/yr, decreasing towards the north. This subduction 
results in relatively high rates of seismicity and a chain of numerous active volcanoes; 
intermediate-focus earthquakes occur within the subducted Cocos plate to depths of nearly 300 km. 
Since 1900, there have been many moderately sized intermediate-depth earthquakes in this region, 
including the September 7, 1915 M7.4 El Salvador and the October 5, 1950 M7.8 Costa Rica events.

The boundary between the Cocos and Nazca plates is characterized by a series of north-south trending 
transform faults and east-west trending spreading centers. The largest and most seismically active of 
these transform boundaries is the Panama Fracture Zone. The Panama Fracture Zone terminates in the 
south at the Galapagos rift zone and in the north at the Middle America trench, where it forms part of 
the Cocos-Nazca-Caribbean triple junction. Earthquakes along the Panama Fracture Zone are generally 
shallow, low- to intermediate in magnitude (M<7.2) and are characteristically right-lateral strike-slip

with a suggested magnitude greater than 8.0. The largest recent intermediate-depth 
earthquake to occur along the Lesser Antilles arc was the November 29, 2007 M7.4 
Martinique earthquake northwest of Fort-De-France.

The southern Caribbean plate boundary with the South America plate strikes east-west 
across Trinidad and western Venezuela at a relative rate of approximately 20 mm/yr. 
This boundary is characterized by major transform faults, including the Central Range 
Fault and the Boconó-San Sebastian-El Pilar Faults, and shallow seismicity. Since 1900, 
the largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the October 29, 1900 M7.7 Caracas 
earthquake, and the July 29, 1967 M6.5 earthquake near this same region. Further to 
the west, a broad zone of compressive deformation trends southwestward across western 
Venezuela and central Colombia. The plate boundary is not well defined across northwestern 
South America, but deformation transitions from being dominated by Caribbean/South America 
convergence in the east to Nazca/South America convergence in the west. The transition zone 
between subduction on the eastern and western margins of the Caribbean plate is 
characterized by diffuse seismicity involving low- to intermediate-magnitude (M<6.0) 
earthquakes of shallow to intermediate depth.

The plate boundary offshore of Colombia is also characterized by convergence, where the Nazca 
plate subducts beneath South America towards the east at a rate of approximately 65 mm/yr.  
The January 31, 1906 M8.5 earthquake occurred on the shallowly dipping megathrust interface 
of this plate boundary segment.  Along the western coast of Central America, the Cocos plate 
subducts towards the east beneath the Caribbean plate at the Middle America Trench. 
Convergence rates vary between 72-81 mm/yr, decreasing towards the north. This subduction 
results in relatively high rates of seismicity and a chain of numerous active volcanoes; 
intermediate-focus earthquakes occur within the subducted Cocos plate to depths of nearly 300 km. 
Since 1900, there have been many moderately sized intermediate-depth earthquakes in this region, 
including the September 7, 1915 M7.4 El Salvador and the October 5, 1950 M7.8 Costa Rica events.

The boundary between the Cocos and Nazca plates is characterized by a series of north-south trending 
transform faults and east-west trending spreading centers. The largest and most seismically active of 
these transform boundaries is the Panama Fracture Zone. The Panama Fracture Zone terminates in the 
south at the Galapagos rift zone and in the north at the Middle America trench, where it forms part of 
the Cocos-Nazca-Caribbean triple junction. Earthquakes along the Panama Fracture Zone are generally 
shallow, low- to intermediate in magnitude (M<7.2) and are characteristically right-lateral strike-slip 
faulting earthquakes.  Since 1900, the largest earthquake to occur along the Panama Fracture Zone was 
the July 26, 1962 M7.2 earthquake.

On August 14, 2021, at approximately 1:29 local time, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake, with a depth of 10.0 km, struck 1 km Northwest of of Nippes, Haiti. The coordinate of epicenter of the earthquake was 18.4167°N, 73.4804°W.

Extensive diversity and complexity of tectonic regimes characterizes the perimeter 
of the Caribbean plate, involving no fewer than four major plates (North America, 
South America, Nazca, and Cocos). Inclined zones of deep earthquakes 
(Wadati-Benioff zones), ocean trenches, and arcs of volcanoes clearly indicate 
subduction of oceanic lithosphere along the Central American and Atlantic Ocean 
margins of the Caribbean plate, while crustal seismicity in Guatemala, northern 
Venezuela, and the Cayman Ridge and Cayman Trench indicate transform fault 
and pull-apart basin tectonics.

Along the northern margin of the Caribbean plate, the North America plate moves 
westwards with respect to the Caribbean plate at a velocity of approximately 20 
mm/yr. Motion is accommodated along several major transform faults that extend 
eastward from Isla de Roatan to Haiti, including the Swan Island Fault and the 
Oriente Fault. These faults represent the southern and northern boundaries of the 
Cayman Trench. Further east, from the Dominican Republic to the Island of Barbuda, 
relative motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean plate becomes 
increasingly complex and is partially accommodated by nearly arc-parallel subduction 
of the North America plate beneath the Caribbean plate. This results in the formation 
of the deep Puerto Rico Trench and a zone of intermediate focus earthquakes 
(70-300 km depth) within the subducted slab. Although the Puerto Rico subduction 
zone is thought to be capable of generating a megathrust earthquake, there have 
been no such events in the past century. The last probable interplate (thrust fault) 
event here occurred on May 2, 1787 and was widely felt throughout the island with 
documented destruction across the entire northern coast, including Arecibo and San 
Juan. Since 1900, the two largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the 
August 4, 1946 M8.0 Samana earthquake in northeastern Hispaniola and the July 29, 
1943 M7.6 Mona Passage earthquake, both of which were shallow thrust fault earthquakes. 
A significant portion of the motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean 
plate in this region is accommodated by a series of left-lateral strike-slip faults that bisect 
the island of Hispaniola, notably the Septentrional Fault in the north and the 
Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault in the south. Activity adjacent to the Enriquillo-Plantain 
Garden Fault system is best documented by the devastating January 12, 2010 M7.0 Haiti 
strike-slip earthquake, its associated aftershocks and a comparable earthquake in 1770.

Moving east and south, the plate boundary curves around Puerto Rico and the northern 
Lesser Antilles where the plate motion vector of the Caribbean plate relative to the North 
and South America plates is less oblique, resulting in active island-arc tectonics.  Here, the 
North and South America plates subduct towards the west beneath the Caribbean plate 
along the Lesser Antilles Trench at rates of approximately 20 mm/yr. As a result of this 
subduction, there exists both intermediate focus earthquakes within the subducted plates 
and a chain of active volcanoes along the island arc. Although the Lesser Antilles is 
considered one of the most seismically active regions in the Caribbean, few of these events

eastward from Isla de Roatan to Haiti, including the Swan Island Fault and the 
Oriente Fault. These faults represent the southern and northern boundaries of the 
Cayman Trench. Further east, from the Dominican Republic to the Island of Barbuda, 
relative motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean plate becomes 
increasingly complex and is partially accommodated by nearly arc-parallel subduction 
of the North America plate beneath the Caribbean plate. This results in the formation 
of the deep Puerto Rico Trench and a zone of intermediate focus earthquakes 
(70-300 km depth) within the subducted slab. Although the Puerto Rico subduction 
zone is thought to be capable of generating a megathrust earthquake, there have 
been no such events in the past century. The last probable interplate (thrust fault) 
event here occurred on May 2, 1787 and was widely felt throughout the island with 
documented destruction across the entire northern coast, including Arecibo and San 
Juan. Since 1900, the two largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the 
August 4, 1946 M8.0 Samana earthquake in northeastern Hispaniola and the July 29, 
1943 M7.6 Mona Passage earthquake, both of which were shallow thrust fault earthquakes. 
A significant portion of the motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean 
plate in this region is accommodated by a series of left-lateral strike-slip faults that bisect 
the island of Hispaniola, notably the Septentrional Fault in the north and the 
Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault in the south. Activity adjacent to the Enriquillo-Plantain 
Garden Fault system is best documented by the devastating January 12, 2010 M7.0 Haiti 
strike-slip earthquake, its associated aftershocks and a comparable earthquake in 1770.

Moving east and south, the plate boundary curves around Puerto Rico and the northern 
Lesser Antilles where the plate motion vector of the Caribbean plate relative to the North 
and South America plates is less oblique, resulting in active island-arc tectonics.  Here, the 
North and South America plates subduct towards the west beneath the Caribbean plate 
along the Lesser Antilles Trench at rates of approximately 20 mm/yr. As a result of this 
subduction, there exists both intermediate focus earthquakes within the subducted plates 
and a chain of active volcanoes along the island arc. Although the Lesser Antilles is 
considered one of the most seismically active regions in the Caribbean, few of these events 
have been greater than M7.0 over the past century. The island of Guadeloupe was the site 
of one of the largest megathrust earthquakes to occur in this region on February 8, 1843, 
with a suggested magnitude greater than 8.0. The largest recent intermediate-depth 
earthquake to occur along the Lesser Antilles arc was the November 29, 2007 M7.4 
Martinique earthquake northwest of Fort-De-France.

The southern Caribbean plate boundary with the South America plate strikes east-west 
across Trinidad and western Venezuela at a relative rate of approximately 20 mm/yr. 
This boundary is characterized by major transform faults, including the Central Range 
Fault and the Boconó-San Sebastian-El Pilar Faults, and shallow seismicity. Since 1900, 
the largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the October 29, 1900 M7.7 Caracas 
earthquake, and the July 29, 1967 M6.5 earthquake near this same region. Further to 
the west, a broad zone of compressive deformation trends southwestward across western 
Venezuela and central Colombia. The plate boundary is not well defined across northwestern 
South America, but deformation transitions from being dominated by Caribbean/South America 
convergence in the east to Nazca/South America convergence in the west. The transition zone 
between subduction on the eastern and western margins of the Caribbean plate is 
characterized by diffuse seismicity involving low- to intermediate-magnitude (M<6.0) 
earthquakes of shallow to intermediate depth.

The plate boundary offshore of Colombia is also characterized by convergence, where the Nazca 
plate subducts beneath South America towards the east at a rate of approximately 65 mm/yr.  
The January 31, 1906 M8.5 earthquake occurred on the shallowly dipping megathrust interface 
of this plate boundary segment.  Along the western coast of Central America, the Cocos plate 
subducts towards the east beneath the Caribbean plate at the Middle America Trench. 
Convergence rates vary between 72-81 mm/yr, decreasing towards the north. This subduction 
results in relatively high rates of seismicity and a chain of numerous active volcanoes; 
intermediate-focus earthquakes occur within the subducted Cocos plate to depths of nearly 300 km. 
Since 1900, there have been many moderately sized intermediate-depth earthquakes in this region, 
including the September 7, 1915 M7.4 El Salvador and the October 5, 1950 M7.8 Costa Rica events.

The boundary between the Cocos and Nazca plates is characterized by a series of north-south trending 
transform faults and east-west trending spreading centers. The largest and most seismically active of 
these transform boundaries is the Panama Fracture Zone. The Panama Fracture Zone terminates in the 
south at the Galapagos rift zone and in the north at the Middle America trench, where it forms part of 
the Cocos-Nazca-Caribbean triple junction. Earthquakes along the Panama Fracture Zone are generally 
shallow, low- to intermediate in magnitude (M<7.2) and are characteristically right-lateral strike-slip 
faulting earthquakes.  Since 1900, the largest earthquake to occur along the Panama Fracture Zone was 
the July 26, 1962 M7.2 earthquake.

On August 14, 2021, at approximately 16:20 local time, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake, with a depth of 12.04 km, struck 12 km North-Northeast of of Chardonnière, Haiti. The coordinate of epicenter of the earthquake was 18.3711°N, 74.0992°W.

Extensive diversity and complexity of tectonic regimes characterizes the perimeter 
of the Caribbean plate, involving no fewer than four major plates (North America, 
South America, Nazca, and Cocos). Inclined zones of deep earthquakes 
(Wadati-Benioff zones), ocean trenches, and arcs of volcanoes clearly indicate 
subduction of oceanic lithosphere along the Central American and Atlantic Ocean 
margins of the Caribbean plate, while crustal seismicity in Guatemala, northern 
Venezuela, and the Cayman Ridge and Cayman Trench indicate transform fault 
and pull-apart basin tectonics.

Along the northern margin of the Caribbean plate, the North America plate moves 
westwards with respect to the Caribbean plate at a velocity of approximately 20 
mm/yr. Motion is accommodated along several major transform faults that extend
