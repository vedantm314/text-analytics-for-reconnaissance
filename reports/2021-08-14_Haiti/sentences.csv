2,"LES CAYES, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Days before a powerful earthquake struck, Rosemond Clermont paid the $1,554 rent on the office of his construction business in southern Haiti for the rest of the year."
3,"On Saturday morning, the investment vanished when his small shop collapsed along with hundreds of other buildings in his home town as the coastal city of Les Cayes began crumbling."
4,"""I don't know what to do."
5,"I'm still in shock,"" said Clermont, 36, the main breadwinner for a family of four."
6,"Dozens of businesses ranging from hotels, restaurants to corner shops in downtown Les Cayes and surrounding areas suffered a similar fate, with premises either badly damaged or flattened."
7,Clermont said the loss capped a tough few years.
8,"He opened the construction business four years ago with the help of a bank loan worth $5,180 to supplement another job at a cell phone service provider, worried that he otherwise would not be able to feed his wife, daughter, 4, and 1-year-old son."
9,The loan saddled Clermont with a monthly debt of $207 that he is struggling to pay off.

12,"Since a devastating earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in 2010, Haiti's economy has been buffeted by chronic political instability, drought and a major hurricane in 2016."

14,"Haitian economist Etzer Emile told Reuters that in the past, small businesses have been overlooked in post-disaster responses."
15,"""And that's the big mistake,"" he said."
16,"""Because these entities are the very backbone of the national economy."""
17,"Clermont's family has been spending nights in the car since the earthquake, scared of possible structural damage at their home after they watched the walls shake violently."
18,"The entire facade of Clermont's office has gone, and as he stood outside the now empty shell, he warily kept his distance from the battered building lest it crumble further."
19,"""I don't know how to get out of this,"" he said."

103,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Haiti's hospitals were swamped on Sunday by thousands of injured residents after a devastating earthquake the day before killed at least 1,297 people as authorities raced to bring doctors to the worst-hit areas before a major storm hits."
104,The 7.2 magnitude quake on Saturday destroyed thousands of homes and buildings in a Caribbean nation which is still clawing its way back from another major temblor 11 years ago and is reeling from the assassination of its president last month.
105,"Southwestern Haiti bore the brunt of the blow, especially in the region in and around the town of Les Cayes."

108,"""We do have a serious issue,"" Jerry Chandler, the head of Haiti's Civil Protection Agency, told Reuters."
109,"""There are very important facilities that are dysfunctional as we speak and those that are functional are receiving an overflow of patients,"" he said."
110,"The challenge facing Haiti has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, a severe economic downturn aggravated by fierce gang violence, and a political crisis that has engulfed the troubled nation after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise on July 7."
111,"Churches, hotels, hospitals and schools were badly damaged or destroyed, while the walls of a prison were rent open by the violent shudders that convulsed Haiti."
112,"Some 13,694 houses were destroyed, the civil protection agency said, suggesting the toll could rise further."
113,"In Les Cayes, a seafront town of some 90,000 people, rescuers in red hard hats and blue overalls pulled bodies from the tangled wreckage of one building, as a yellow mechanical excavator nearby helped to shift the rubble."
114,"Haiti's Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who flew to visit Les Cayes, praised the dignity shown by people there even in the midst of their suffering."
115,"""They are affected but resilient."
116,"They fight to survive,"" he said, thanking international agencies and foreign governments for their support."

127,"At Port-au-Prince airport, international aid workers, doctors and rescue workers boarded flights to Les Cayes."
128,A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter ferried the wounded.
129,"The rescue and aid efforts will be complicated by Tropical Depression Grace, which is expected to lash Haiti with heavy rainfall on Monday."
130,"Some 75 to 100 milliliters of rainfall was expected, which may trigger landslides and cause some rivers to flood, Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said."
131,"""We ask the population to remain vigilant,"" the agency added."
132,"Thousands of people sleeping in the streets would be exposed to the torrential rains amid a rising risk of water-borne diseases, said Chandler, the head of the agency."

137,Footage of Saturday's aftermath posted on social media showed residents reaching into narrow openings in piles of fallen masonry to pull shocked and distraught people from the debris of walls and roofs that had crumbled around them.
138,Access to the worst-hit areas was complicated by a deterioration in law and order that has left key access roads in parts of Haiti in the hands of gangs.
139,"In a video posted on social media, one gang leader said the armed groups had declared a truce along the route to Les Cayes."
140,Chandler said boats and helicopters were being used to bring in aid but the government was working to establish safe access by road.
141,A first convoy of aid had made it through by land to the region of Les Cayes.
142,"The United Nations called for a ""humanitarian corridor"" to be established so that aid can pass through gang-held territories."
143,"Following Moise's assassination, which authorities have alleged was carried out by a group of largely Colombian mercenaries and Haitian accomplices, Prime Minister Henry said officials would aim to hold elections for a new president as soon as possible."
144,"However, reports this week suggested that the vote initially earmarked for September would not take place until November."
145,The chaos unleashed by Saturday's disaster is likely to make the task of holding prompt elections harder still.
146,Haiti has long been politically unstable and Haitians have also suffered from problems stemming from international aid efforts and peace-keeping deployments during the past decade.
147,"A sexual misconduct scandal centering on Oxfam International blighted the record of charity workers in Haiti, while a cholera outbreak linked to U.N. peacekeepers led to thousands of deaths."

266,"Last year, Haiti ranked 104 out of the 107 countries on the Global Hunger Index."
267,"By September, the United Nations said 4 million Haitians - 42% of the population - faced acute food insecurity."
268,"This month's earthquake has exacerbated the crisis: destroying crops and livestock, leveling markets, contaminating waterways used as sources of drinking water, and damaging bridges and roads crucial to reaching villages like Nan Konsey."
269,"The number of people in urgent need of food assistance in the three departments hardest-hit by the earthquake - Sud, Grand'Anse and Nippes - has increased by one-third since the quake, from 138,000 to 215,000, according to the World Food Programme (WFP)."
270,"""The earthquake rattled people who were already struggling to feed their families,"" Lola Castro, WFP's regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, said in a statement."
271,"""The compound effects of multiple crises are devastating communities in the south faced with some of the highest levels of food insecurity in the country."""
272,'IN THE HANDS OF GOD'
273,"Just off the highway leading to Nan Konsey, a few dozen men gathered at a goat market, where they sold off their remaining livestock to secure cash to feed their children or to pay for family members' funerals."
274,"Before the quake, farmer Michel Pierre had tended 15 goats and cultivated yams, potatoes, corn, and banana trees."
275,He arrived at the market with the only two animals that survived the earthquake.
276,"With his crops also buried beneath landslides, he hoped to earn about $100 from the sale to feed himself, his wife and his children."
277,"When that money runs dry, he said, he isn't sure what he will do."
278,He is still in debt from when Hurricane Matthew ravaged Haiti in 2016.
279,"""Day by day, it's getting harder to be a farmer,"" he said."
280,"""I am in the hands of God."""
281,"Haiti was largely food self-sufficient until the 1980s, when at the encouragement of the United States it started loosening restrictions on crop imports and lowered tariffs."
282,A subsequent flood of surplus U.S. crops put droves of Haitian farmers out of business and contributed to investment in the sector tailing off.
283,"In recent years, climate change has made Hispaniola - the island Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic - increasingly vulnerable to extreme droughts and hurricanes."
284,"Spiraling food costs, economic decline and political instability have worsened the shortages."
285,"For Gethro Polyte, a teacher and farmer living north of the town of Camp-Perrin, the earthquake decimated his two main sources of income: leveling the school where he taught fourth grade, and submerging his crops and livestock in an avalanche of earth."
286,"Before the disaster, he and his family had been able to pull together two meals a day and draw water from underground springs, he said."
287,"But since then, his food supplies have dwindled down to a few yams and bananas, and the water has been contaminated with silt."
288,"Polyte doubted the school would be rebuilt for classes to start in September and for him to receive a paycheck, given the chaos following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July."
289,"And with bank loans still to pay off, he doubted he'd be able to secure money to invest in rebuilding his farm."

309,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The earthquake that ravaged Haiti on Saturday has revived anger over international aid agencies' response to a devastating quake there 11 years ago, stirring calls to ensure donations do a better job of reaching the people who need them most."
310,"Haitians and well-wishers have taken to social media to urge donors to send money directly to Haitian charities or via the government, criticizing what they saw as misuse of funds after the 2010 quake and a major hurricane in 2016."
311,"Despite billions of dollars in aid, Haiti has slipped down global development rankings, violence is widespread and its institutions were already in turmoil when President Jovenel Moise was shot dead last month by what the government says was a group of largely Colombian mercenaries."
312,"Saturday's quake in the poorest country in the Americas killed at least 1,419 people and injured thousands more."
313,read more
314,"It prompted pledges of support from U.N. bodies, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Red Cross and governments around the world."
315,"But with the scars of the last quake still visible in the Caribbean nation's capital Port-au-Prince, there were calls right from the top for the aid response to be different in 2021."
316,"""We will not repeat the same things that were done in 2010,"" Prime Minister Ariel Henry said on Monday."
317,"""A lot of donations were made to the country, and a lot of money was spent without seeing the impact."""
318,"Jonathan Katz, a journalist and author of ""The Big Truck That Went By,"" a damning critique of the international response to the 2010 earthquake, which killed more than 200,000 people, said the money needed to go directly to the Haitian population."
319,"""The world had 11 years to prepare for the next earthquake."
320,"We did not,"" he added."
321,"""Don't shuffle money from the State Department to the Defense Department by way of USAID and tell the world that that was money for Haiti."""
322,"Much of the U.S. military spending right after the natural disaster was more focused on preventing social unrest and deterring mass migration than rebuilding, said Katz."
323,The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
324,"The State Department said that, while it spent money evacuating staff and U.S. citizens and keeping the local embassy operating in 2010, its diplomatic programs had ""no relation"" to security assistance, military spending or migration programs."
325,"USAID, which has dispatched a team to Haiti to help relief efforts, pointed Reuters to recent congressional testimony by Barbara Feinstein, acting senior deputy assistant administrator within its bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean."
326,"Feinstein highlighted improvements in infant mortality rates in Haiti and said that in 2020 alone, USAID had supported the vaccination of more than 75,000 children there and provided care to tens of thousands of women and newborn babies."
327,"USAID had also benefited local farming, with its investments supporting 105,000 farmers to adopt new technologies, generating nearly $30 million in agricultural sales, she said."
328,MISSING AID
329,Haiti's government complained after the 2010 quake that aid was too slow to materialize.
330,"Six months after the disaster, it said it had received less than2 percent of the promised support, despite pledges by the U.N. special envoy for Haiti, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, to ""build Haiti back better""."
331,"A 2012 study by Tulane University found that while some aid exceeded the population's needs in affected areas, humanitarian efforts did not contribute significantly to making Haiti more resilient to disasters and may even have ""caused harm."""
332,"It argued the humanitarian response often undermined Haitian organizations due to the poaching of staff, and because they could not compete with larger, international NGOs for support, or lacked access to the decision-making process."
333,The American Red Cross in particular has been singled out for what critics said was the low impact of some $500 million in donations it received after the 2010 quake.
334,"""Donate to HAITIAN ORGANIZATIONS ONLY!"
335,Can't stress this enough.
336,"Haiti Based ONLY,"" Jessie Woo, a Haitian-American comedienne, said on Twitter."
337,"""DO NOT DONATE ANY MONEY TO THE RED CROSS REGARDING HAITI."""
338,The American Red Cross has said it spent 91 cents of every dollar of that money in programs to help the people of Haiti.
339,"In a statement to Reuters, the American Red Cross said it ""strongly disputes negative reporting of our past work in Haiti"" and had made a significant impact there."
340,"This included investment in more than 50 hospitals and clinics, safer housing for more than 22,000 families, funding for Haiti's first wastewater treatment plant and support for the country's first-ever cholera vaccination campaign."
341,"""Americans donated generously in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake to save lives - which is exactly what their donations did,"" it said."
342,Controversies linked to foreign intervention have reinforced a sense of public mistrust.
343,"A sexual misconduct scandal that surfaced in 2018 centering on Oxfam International tarnished the name of relief workers in Haiti, while a cholera outbreak linked to U.N. peacekeepers in the country after the 2010 quake led to thousands of deaths."
344,"Even as countries like Mexico began flying in aid, Haiti's government urged donors to go through its civil protection agency to better coordinate efforts this time."
345,"""As we want to avoid the proliferation of tented camps, the ministry asks NGOs to distribute tents and tarpaulins to the identified people whose homes have been damaged to enable them to spend the night close to their residence,"" it said."
346,"Over 1 million survivors of the 2010 quake spent months in makeshift tent camps crammed into Port-au-Prince, exposing them to the elements, lawlessness and the cholera outbreak."
347,The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) said on Monday that Haiti's government was preparing a needs list and had asked for cash donations so humanitarian goods could be bought in the country.
348,A major criticism of the 2010 response was that imports of foreign aid damaged Haitian farming and commerce.
349,"One diplomat, who asked not to be identified, expressed confidence that the ad hoc government Haiti had assembled after Moise's assassination seemed to be taking a ""big leap forward"" in coordinating aid efforts."
350,"But Haiti, which has only just begun administering its first publicly distributed vaccines against COVID-19, may not be in the spotlight as much this time, with events such as the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan dominating the news, argued Katz."
351,"""I think it's going to get a lot less attention than the 2010 earthquake,"" he said."

369,"MARCELINE, Haiti, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Haitians desperate for food looted a humanitarian convoy on Friday and fought over donations as anger built over the slow pace of aid deliveries almost a week after a devastating earthquake killed more than 2,000 people."
370,"Damaged or impassable roads have hindered efforts to deliver aid to remote parts in the south of the impoverished Caribbean nation, which were hardest-hit by last Saturday's 7.2 magnitude earthquake."
371,"With hundreds still missing, hopes are fading of finding anyone still alive."
372,Aid organization Food for the Poor said that four of its trucks were attacked by local residents and looted on Friday as they delivered food and water to rural communities in the south.
373,"Neither the drivers nor the trucks were harmed, the charity said, and five other trucks were able to reach their destinations safely."
374,"""Food For The Poor remains committed to its mission of helping those affected by this terrible tragedy,"" it said in a statement, adding that its staff were working hard to reach the most remote communities in need."
375,"In the hard-hit city of Les Cayes, scuffles broke out after former President Michel Martelly visited a local hospital on Friday afternoon."
376,"A member of his staff gave an envelope filled with cash to one person in the crowd to be distributed amongst them, triggering a violent scramble for the money, a Reuters witness said."
377,Landslides and cracks in the tarmac on the mountain road between Les Cayes and Jeremie to its northwest - two of the worst-affected urban areas - made it harder to dispatch aid to farming communities short of food and drinkable water.
378,The route was littered with boulders and the occasional stranded truck.
379,"""We are all absolutely overwhelmed,"" Prime Minister Ariel Henry said in a meeting with the Organization of American States, saying some communities had been flattened."
380,"""Every commune, every city, every village in that area was very hard hit."""
381,Henry thanked foreign allies for sending assistance.
382,"The poorest country in the Americas, Haiti is still recovering from a 2010 quake that killed over 200,000 people."
383,It was pitched into deeper instability by the assassination on July 7 of President Jovenel Moise by what authorities say was a group of largely Colombian mercenaries.
384,"Last Saturday's quake destroyed tens of thousands of homes and claimed the lives of at least 2,189 people."
385,"Some 332 people are missing, while 12,200 people were injured, authorities said."
386,A powerful storm this week that triggered landslides made the search for victims even harder.
387,Many hospitals remained saturated in the worst-hit areas.
388,"At Les Cayes' airport, helicopters ferried the injured to the capital, Port-au-Prince."
389,"The kidnapping by gangs of two doctors in the capital, including one of the few trained orthopedic surgeons in Haiti, has added to the strain."
390,"Some hospitals shut down temporarily in protest, demanding the doctors be released, local media reported."
391,DIGGING GRAVES
392,"In the village of Marceline, 25 km (16 miles) north of Les Cayes, hundreds of people gathered to receive food and medical care at a mobile clinic and aid distribution effort organized by Haitian non-profit PWOP."
393,"One of the patients was a girl who had debris embedded in a gash just below her knee, which cut down to the bone."
394,She screamed in pain as the doctors cleaned and disinfected the wound without anesthesia.
395,"Elsewhere in the village, some people dug graves to prepare for funerals, while other residents worked to remove a massive heap of rubble in efforts to find the remains of loved ones."
396,The air smelled of decomposing bodies.
397,Amerlin Dorcy surveyed the rescue efforts.
398,His mother Seralia Dejoit had been attending a voodoo ceremony in the house when the quake struck.
399,"""She's still missing."
400,"We don't even have her body to bury,"" said Dorcy, explaining that his mother had been called upon to sing at the ceremony by the head priestess."
401,"The calamity brought back memories for Dorcy of the 2010 quake, which he survived by fleeing the collapsing three-story building he was inside in Port-au-Prince."
402,"""Now there's another earthquake and it's my mother who's the victim,"" he said."

420,"LES CAYES, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Days before a powerful earthquake struck, Rosemond Clermont paid the $1,554 rent on the office of his construction business in southern Haiti for the rest of the year."
421,"On Saturday morning, the investment vanished when his small shop collapsed along with hundreds of other buildings in his home town as the coastal city of Les Cayes began crumbling."
422,"""I don't know what to do."
423,"I'm still in shock,"" said Clermont, 36, the main breadwinner for a family of four."
424,"Dozens of businesses ranging from hotels, restaurants to corner shops in downtown Les Cayes and surrounding areas suffered a similar fate, with premises either badly damaged or flattened."
425,Clermont said the loss capped a tough few years.
426,"He opened the construction business four years ago with the help of a bank loan worth $5,180 to supplement another job at a cell phone service provider, worried that he otherwise would not be able to feed his wife, daughter, 4, and 1-year-old son."

429,"""I owe money to the bank, we have nowhere to sleep, and I have my family to feed."""
430,"Since a devastating earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in 2010, Haiti's economy has been buffeted by chronic political instability, drought and a major hurricane in 2016."

435,"Clermont's family has been spending nights in the car since the earthquake, scared of possible structural damage at their home after they watched the walls shake violently."
436,"The entire facade of Clermont's office has gone, and as he stood outside the now empty shell, he warily kept his distance from the battered building lest it crumble further."

522,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Haiti's hospitals were swamped on Sunday by thousands of injured residents after a devastating earthquake the day before killed at least 1,297 people as authorities raced to bring doctors to the worst-hit areas before a major storm hits."
523,The 7.2 magnitude quake on Saturday destroyed thousands of homes and buildings in a Caribbean nation which is still clawing its way back from another major temblor 11 years ago and is reeling from the assassination of its president last month.
524,"Southwestern Haiti bore the brunt of the blow, especially in the region in and around the town of Les Cayes."
525,"Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said the toll from the disaster had climbed to 1,297 and the hospitals that were still functioning were struggling to cope as some 5,700 people were injured."
526,"In the northwestern city of Jeremie, another badly hit area, doctors treated injured patients on hospital stretchers underneath trees and on mattresses by the side of the road, as healthcare centers have run out of space."
527,"""We do have a serious issue,"" Jerry Chandler, the head of Haiti's Civil Protection Agency, told Reuters."
528,"""There are very important facilities that are dysfunctional as we speak and those that are functional are receiving an overflow of patients,"" he said."
529,"The challenge facing Haiti has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, a severe economic downturn aggravated by fierce gang violence, and a political crisis that has engulfed the troubled nation after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise on July 7."
530,"Churches, hotels, hospitals and schools were badly damaged or destroyed, while the walls of a prison were rent open by the violent shudders that convulsed Haiti."
531,"Some 13,694 houses were destroyed, the civil protection agency said, suggesting the toll could rise further."
532,"In Les Cayes, a seafront town of some 90,000 people, rescuers in red hard hats and blue overalls pulled bodies from the tangled wreckage of one building, as a yellow mechanical excavator nearby helped to shift the rubble."
533,"Haiti's Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who flew to visit Les Cayes, praised the dignity shown by people there even in the midst of their suffering."
534,"""They are affected but resilient."
535,"They fight to survive,"" he said, thanking international agencies and foreign governments for their support."
536,"Nearby countries, including the Dominican Republic and Mexico, rushed to send desperately needed food and medicines by air and across Haiti's land border."
537,Colombia sent search and rescue personnel.
538,"The United States dispatched vital supplies and deployed a 65-person urban search-and-rescue team with specialized equipment, said Samantha Power, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)."
539,"From the Vatican, Pope Francis urged the international community to show support swiftly."
540,"""May solidarity from everyone lighten the consequences of the tragedy,"" he told pilgrims and tourists at his Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square."
541,"However, Haiti's government appealed to aid organizations against setting up makeshift camps and urged them to work through the planning ministry, an apparent attempt to avoid the mistakes made following the devastating 2010 earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people."

545,"Many Haitians prepared on Sunday to spend a second night sleeping in the open, traumatized by memories of that magnitude 7 quake 11 years ago that struck far closer to the sprawling capital, Port-au-Prince."
546,"At Port-au-Prince airport, international aid workers, doctors and rescue workers boarded flights to Les Cayes."
547,A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter ferried the wounded.
548,"The rescue and aid efforts will be complicated by Tropical Depression Grace, which is expected to lash Haiti with heavy rainfall on Monday."
549,"Some 75 to 100 milliliters of rainfall was expected, which may trigger landslides and cause some rivers to flood, Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said."
550,"""We ask the population to remain vigilant,"" the agency added."
551,"Thousands of people sleeping in the streets would be exposed to the torrential rains amid a rising risk of water-borne diseases, said Chandler, the head of the agency."
552,The death toll is expected to rise as telephone network has been down in more remote areas.
553,"In difficult-to-reach villages many houses were fragile and built on slopes vulnerable to landslides, said Alix Percinthe, from the ActionAid charity."
554,He said one local leader had informed him there were 47 deaths in his area not yet reported to regional authorities.
555,HUMANITARIAN CORRIDOR
556,Footage of Saturday's aftermath posted on social media showed residents reaching into narrow openings in piles of fallen masonry to pull shocked and distraught people from the debris of walls and roofs that had crumbled around them.
557,Access to the worst-hit areas was complicated by a deterioration in law and order that has left key access roads in parts of Haiti in the hands of gangs.
558,"In a video posted on social media, one gang leader said the armed groups had declared a truce along the route to Les Cayes."
559,Chandler said boats and helicopters were being used to bring in aid but the government was working to establish safe access by road.
560,A first convoy of aid had made it through by land to the region of Les Cayes.
561,"The United Nations called for a ""humanitarian corridor"" to be established so that aid can pass through gang-held territories."
562,"Following Moise's assassination, which authorities have alleged was carried out by a group of largely Colombian mercenaries and Haitian accomplices, Prime Minister Henry said officials would aim to hold elections for a new president as soon as possible."
563,"However, reports this week suggested that the vote initially earmarked for September would not take place until November."
564,The chaos unleashed by Saturday's disaster is likely to make the task of holding prompt elections harder still.
565,Haiti has long been politically unstable and Haitians have also suffered from problems stemming from international aid efforts and peace-keeping deployments during the past decade.
566,"A sexual misconduct scandal centering on Oxfam International blighted the record of charity workers in Haiti, while a cholera outbreak linked to U.N. peacekeepers led to thousands of deaths."

614,They were among the hundreds of people killed when a devastating earthquake struck Haiti early on Saturday.
615,Both died when the entrance and part of the ceiling to the St Famille du Toirac church collapsed.
616,Residents say an estimated 20 lives were lost in the building in the tight-knit rural community inland from the city of Les Cayes.

692,"NAN KONSEY, Haiti, Aug 30 (Reuters) - In a tent encampment in the mountains of southern Haiti, where hundreds of villagers sought shelter after a powerful earthquake flattened their homes this month, a single charred cob of corn was the only food in sight."
693,"""I'm hungry and my baby is hungry,"" said Sofonie Samedy, gesturing to her pregnant stomach."
694,"Samedy had eaten only intermittently since the 7.2-magnitude earthquake on Aug. 14 destroyed much of Nan Konsey, a remote farming village not far from the epicenter."
695,"Across Haiti, the quake killed more than 2,000 people and left tens of thousands homeless."
696,"In Nan Konsey, the earth's convulsions tore open the village's cement cisterns used to store drinking water and triggered landslides that interred residents' modest subsistence farms."
697,"Since then, Samedy and the rest of the community have camped alongside the main highway, about a 40-minute walk from their village, hoping to flag down the rare passing truck to ask for food and water."
698,"""I'm praying I can still give birth to a healthy baby, but of course I'm a little afraid,"" she said."
699,"Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, has long had one of the world's highest levels of food insecurity."
700,"Last year, Haiti ranked 104 out of the 107 countries on the Global Hunger Index."
701,"By September, the United Nations said 4 million Haitians - 42% of the population - faced acute food insecurity."
702,"This month's earthquake has exacerbated the crisis: destroying crops and livestock, leveling markets, contaminating waterways used as sources of drinking water, and damaging bridges and roads crucial to reaching villages like Nan Konsey."
703,"The number of people in urgent need of food assistance in the three departments hardest-hit by the earthquake - Sud, Grand'Anse and Nippes - has increased by one-third since the quake, from 138,000 to 215,000, according to the World Food Programme (WFP)."
704,"""The earthquake rattled people who were already struggling to feed their families,"" Lola Castro, WFP's regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, said in a statement."
705,"""The compound effects of multiple crises are devastating communities in the south faced with some of the highest levels of food insecurity in the country."""
706,'IN THE HANDS OF GOD'
707,"Just off the highway leading to Nan Konsey, a few dozen men gathered at a goat market, where they sold off their remaining livestock to secure cash to feed their children or to pay for family members' funerals."
708,"Before the quake, farmer Michel Pierre had tended 15 goats and cultivated yams, potatoes, corn, and banana trees."
709,He arrived at the market with the only two animals that survived the earthquake.
710,"With his crops also buried beneath landslides, he hoped to earn about $100 from the sale to feed himself, his wife and his children."
711,"When that money runs dry, he said, he isn't sure what he will do."
712,He is still in debt from when Hurricane Matthew ravaged Haiti in 2016.
713,"""Day by day, it's getting harder to be a farmer,"" he said."
714,"""I am in the hands of God."""
715,"Haiti was largely food self-sufficient until the 1980s, when at the encouragement of the United States it started loosening restrictions on crop imports and lowered tariffs."
716,A subsequent flood of surplus U.S. crops put droves of Haitian farmers out of business and contributed to investment in the sector tailing off.
717,"In recent years, climate change has made Hispaniola - the island Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic - increasingly vulnerable to extreme droughts and hurricanes."
718,"Spiraling food costs, economic decline and political instability have worsened the shortages."
719,"For Gethro Polyte, a teacher and farmer living north of the town of Camp-Perrin, the earthquake decimated his two main sources of income: leveling the school where he taught fourth grade, and submerging his crops and livestock in an avalanche of earth."
720,"Before the disaster, he and his family had been able to pull together two meals a day and draw water from underground springs, he said."
721,"But since then, his food supplies have dwindled down to a few yams and bananas, and the water has been contaminated with silt."
722,"Polyte doubted the school would be rebuilt for classes to start in September and for him to receive a paycheck, given the chaos following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July."
723,"And with bank loans still to pay off, he doubted he'd be able to secure money to invest in rebuilding his farm."
724,"""We are living now by eating a little something just to kill the hunger,"" he said."

743,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The earthquake that ravaged Haiti on Saturday has revived anger over international aid agencies' response to a devastating quake there 11 years ago, stirring calls to ensure donations do a better job of reaching the people who need them most."
744,"Haitians and well-wishers have taken to social media to urge donors to send money directly to Haitian charities or via the government, criticizing what they saw as misuse of funds after the 2010 quake and a major hurricane in 2016."
745,"Despite billions of dollars in aid, Haiti has slipped down global development rankings, violence is widespread and its institutions were already in turmoil when President Jovenel Moise was shot dead last month by what the government says was a group of largely Colombian mercenaries."
746,"Saturday's quake in the poorest country in the Americas killed at least 1,419 people and injured thousands more."
747,read more
748,"It prompted pledges of support from U.N. bodies, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Red Cross and governments around the world."
749,"But with the scars of the last quake still visible in the Caribbean nation's capital Port-au-Prince, there were calls right from the top for the aid response to be different in 2021."
750,"""We will not repeat the same things that were done in 2010,"" Prime Minister Ariel Henry said on Monday."
751,"""A lot of donations were made to the country, and a lot of money was spent without seeing the impact."""
752,"Jonathan Katz, a journalist and author of ""The Big Truck That Went By,"" a damning critique of the international response to the 2010 earthquake, which killed more than 200,000 people, said the money needed to go directly to the Haitian population."
753,"""The world had 11 years to prepare for the next earthquake."
754,"We did not,"" he added."
755,"""Don't shuffle money from the State Department to the Defense Department by way of USAID and tell the world that that was money for Haiti."""
756,"Much of the U.S. military spending right after the natural disaster was more focused on preventing social unrest and deterring mass migration than rebuilding, said Katz."
757,The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
758,"The State Department said that, while it spent money evacuating staff and U.S. citizens and keeping the local embassy operating in 2010, its diplomatic programs had ""no relation"" to security assistance, military spending or migration programs."
759,"USAID, which has dispatched a team to Haiti to help relief efforts, pointed Reuters to recent congressional testimony by Barbara Feinstein, acting senior deputy assistant administrator within its bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean."
760,"Feinstein highlighted improvements in infant mortality rates in Haiti and said that in 2020 alone, USAID had supported the vaccination of more than 75,000 children there and provided care to tens of thousands of women and newborn babies."
761,"USAID had also benefited local farming, with its investments supporting 105,000 farmers to adopt new technologies, generating nearly $30 million in agricultural sales, she said."
762,MISSING AID
763,Haiti's government complained after the 2010 quake that aid was too slow to materialize.
764,"Six months after the disaster, it said it had received less than2 percent of the promised support, despite pledges by the U.N. special envoy for Haiti, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, to ""build Haiti back better""."
765,"A 2012 study by Tulane University found that while some aid exceeded the population's needs in affected areas, humanitarian efforts did not contribute significantly to making Haiti more resilient to disasters and may even have ""caused harm."""
766,"It argued the humanitarian response often undermined Haitian organizations due to the poaching of staff, and because they could not compete with larger, international NGOs for support, or lacked access to the decision-making process."
767,The American Red Cross in particular has been singled out for what critics said was the low impact of some $500 million in donations it received after the 2010 quake.
768,"""Donate to HAITIAN ORGANIZATIONS ONLY!"
769,Can't stress this enough.
770,"Haiti Based ONLY,"" Jessie Woo, a Haitian-American comedienne, said on Twitter."
771,"""DO NOT DONATE ANY MONEY TO THE RED CROSS REGARDING HAITI."""
772,The American Red Cross has said it spent 91 cents of every dollar of that money in programs to help the people of Haiti.
773,"In a statement to Reuters, the American Red Cross said it ""strongly disputes negative reporting of our past work in Haiti"" and had made a significant impact there."
774,"This included investment in more than 50 hospitals and clinics, safer housing for more than 22,000 families, funding for Haiti's first wastewater treatment plant and support for the country's first-ever cholera vaccination campaign."
775,"""Americans donated generously in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake to save lives - which is exactly what their donations did,"" it said."
776,Controversies linked to foreign intervention have reinforced a sense of public mistrust.
777,"A sexual misconduct scandal that surfaced in 2018 centering on Oxfam International tarnished the name of relief workers in Haiti, while a cholera outbreak linked to U.N. peacekeepers in the country after the 2010 quake led to thousands of deaths."
778,"Even as countries like Mexico began flying in aid, Haiti's government urged donors to go through its civil protection agency to better coordinate efforts this time."
779,"""As we want to avoid the proliferation of tented camps, the ministry asks NGOs to distribute tents and tarpaulins to the identified people whose homes have been damaged to enable them to spend the night close to their residence,"" it said."
780,"Over 1 million survivors of the 2010 quake spent months in makeshift tent camps crammed into Port-au-Prince, exposing them to the elements, lawlessness and the cholera outbreak."
781,The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) said on Monday that Haiti's government was preparing a needs list and had asked for cash donations so humanitarian goods could be bought in the country.
782,A major criticism of the 2010 response was that imports of foreign aid damaged Haitian farming and commerce.
783,"One diplomat, who asked not to be identified, expressed confidence that the ad hoc government Haiti had assembled after Moise's assassination seemed to be taking a ""big leap forward"" in coordinating aid efforts."
784,"But Haiti, which has only just begun administering its first publicly distributed vaccines against COVID-19, may not be in the spotlight as much this time, with events such as the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan dominating the news, argued Katz."
785,"""I think it's going to get a lot less attention than the 2010 earthquake,"" he said."

803,"MARCELINE, Haiti, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Haitians desperate for food looted a humanitarian convoy on Friday and fought over donations as anger built over the slow pace of aid deliveries almost a week after a devastating earthquake killed more than 2,000 people."
804,"Damaged or impassable roads have hindered efforts to deliver aid to remote parts in the south of the impoverished Caribbean nation, which were hardest-hit by last Saturday's 7.2 magnitude earthquake."
805,"With hundreds still missing, hopes are fading of finding anyone still alive."
806,Aid organization Food for the Poor said that four of its trucks were attacked by local residents and looted on Friday as they delivered food and water to rural communities in the south.
807,"Neither the drivers nor the trucks were harmed, the charity said, and five other trucks were able to reach their destinations safely."
808,"""Food For The Poor remains committed to its mission of helping those affected by this terrible tragedy,"" it said in a statement, adding that its staff were working hard to reach the most remote communities in need."
809,"In the hard-hit city of Les Cayes, scuffles broke out after former President Michel Martelly visited a local hospital on Friday afternoon."
810,"A member of his staff gave an envelope filled with cash to one person in the crowd to be distributed amongst them, triggering a violent scramble for the money, a Reuters witness said."
811,Landslides and cracks in the tarmac on the mountain road between Les Cayes and Jeremie to its northwest - two of the worst-affected urban areas - made it harder to dispatch aid to farming communities short of food and drinkable water.
812,The route was littered with boulders and the occasional stranded truck.
813,"""We are all absolutely overwhelmed,"" Prime Minister Ariel Henry said in a meeting with the Organization of American States, saying some communities had been flattened."
814,"""Every commune, every city, every village in that area was very hard hit."""
815,Henry thanked foreign allies for sending assistance.
816,"The poorest country in the Americas, Haiti is still recovering from a 2010 quake that killed over 200,000 people."
817,It was pitched into deeper instability by the assassination on July 7 of President Jovenel Moise by what authorities say was a group of largely Colombian mercenaries.
818,"Last Saturday's quake destroyed tens of thousands of homes and claimed the lives of at least 2,189 people."
819,"Some 332 people are missing, while 12,200 people were injured, authorities said."
820,A powerful storm this week that triggered landslides made the search for victims even harder.
821,Many hospitals remained saturated in the worst-hit areas.
822,"At Les Cayes' airport, helicopters ferried the injured to the capital, Port-au-Prince."
823,"The kidnapping by gangs of two doctors in the capital, including one of the few trained orthopedic surgeons in Haiti, has added to the strain."
824,"Some hospitals shut down temporarily in protest, demanding the doctors be released, local media reported."
825,DIGGING GRAVES
826,"In the village of Marceline, 25 km (16 miles) north of Les Cayes, hundreds of people gathered to receive food and medical care at a mobile clinic and aid distribution effort organized by Haitian non-profit PWOP."
827,"One of the patients was a girl who had debris embedded in a gash just below her knee, which cut down to the bone."
828,She screamed in pain as the doctors cleaned and disinfected the wound without anesthesia.
829,"Elsewhere in the village, some people dug graves to prepare for funerals, while other residents worked to remove a massive heap of rubble in efforts to find the remains of loved ones."
830,The air smelled of decomposing bodies.
831,Amerlin Dorcy surveyed the rescue efforts.
832,His mother Seralia Dejoit had been attending a voodoo ceremony in the house when the quake struck.
833,"""She's still missing."
834,"We don't even have her body to bury,"" said Dorcy, explaining that his mother had been called upon to sing at the ceremony by the head priestess."
835,"The calamity brought back memories for Dorcy of the 2010 quake, which he survived by fleeing the collapsing three-story building he was inside in Port-au-Prince."
836,"""Now there's another earthquake and it's my mother who's the victim,"" he said."

854,"LES CAYES, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Days before a powerful earthquake struck, Rosemond Clermont paid the $1,554 rent on the office of his construction business in southern Haiti for the rest of the year."
855,"On Saturday morning, the investment vanished when his small shop collapsed along with hundreds of other buildings in his home town as the coastal city of Les Cayes began crumbling."
856,"""I don't know what to do."
857,"I'm still in shock,"" said Clermont, 36, the main breadwinner for a family of four."
858,"Dozens of businesses ranging from hotels, restaurants to corner shops in downtown Les Cayes and surrounding areas suffered a similar fate, with premises either badly damaged or flattened."
859,Clermont said the loss capped a tough few years.
860,"He opened the construction business four years ago with the help of a bank loan worth $5,180 to supplement another job at a cell phone service provider, worried that he otherwise would not be able to feed his wife, daughter, 4, and 1-year-old son."
861,The loan saddled Clermont with a monthly debt of $207 that he is struggling to pay off.
862,"""The economic situation is so much worse than before,"" he said."
863,"""I owe money to the bank, we have nowhere to sleep, and I have my family to feed."""
864,"Since a devastating earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in 2010, Haiti's economy has been buffeted by chronic political instability, drought and a major hurricane in 2016."
865,"Opposition-backed protests against the government dragged Haiti into recession in 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic even hit, and a steady deprecation in the gourde currency has put pressure on businesses heavily reliant on foreign imports."
866,"Haitian economist Etzer Emile told Reuters that in the past, small businesses have been overlooked in post-disaster responses."

869,"Clermont's family has been spending nights in the car since the earthquake, scared of possible structural damage at their home after they watched the walls shake violently."

907,Relief efforts were already complicated due to political turmoil and difficult road access from the capital to the south due to gang control of key points.
908,"Flash flooding and landslides in the wake of Tropical Storm Grace, which by Tuesday afternoon had continued on past Jamaica, exacerbated the situation."
909,"""Countless Haitian families who have lost everything due to the earthquake are now living literally with their feet in the water due to the flooding,"" said Bruno Maes, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) representative in the country."

957,The 7.2 magnitude quake on Saturday destroyed thousands of homes and buildings in a Caribbean nation which is still clawing its way back from another major temblor 11 years ago and is reeling from the assassination of its president last month.
958,"Southwestern Haiti bore the brunt of the blow, especially in the region in and around the town of Les Cayes."

961,"""We do have a serious issue,"" Jerry Chandler, the head of Haiti's Civil Protection Agency, told Reuters."
962,"""There are very important facilities that are dysfunctional as we speak and those that are functional are receiving an overflow of patients,"" he said."
963,"The challenge facing Haiti has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, a severe economic downturn aggravated by fierce gang violence, and a political crisis that has engulfed the troubled nation after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise on July 7."
964,"Churches, hotels, hospitals and schools were badly damaged or destroyed, while the walls of a prison were rent open by the violent shudders that convulsed Haiti."

990,Footage of Saturday's aftermath posted on social media showed residents reaching into narrow openings in piles of fallen masonry to pull shocked and distraught people from the debris of walls and roofs that had crumbled around them.
991,Access to the worst-hit areas was complicated by a deterioration in law and order that has left key access roads in parts of Haiti in the hands of gangs.

993,Chandler said boats and helicopters were being used to bring in aid but the government was working to establish safe access by road.
